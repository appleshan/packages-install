#+TITLE: Auto Install Bash Scripts

A bash script to install what I think are necessary applications. 

* Instructions
1. Download bash script to a folder (ex: /Documents or /Downloads)
2. Right click on file to give execute permissions
3. Go to terminal and change to directory where you put downloaded file (ex: cd Downloads)
4. Type in terminal sudo ./install.sh to run
   - You may also need to type chmod +x ./installscript if you forgot to do step 2
